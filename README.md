# House-prices
This project aims to predict house prices using Linear regression, Ridge regularization, Lasso, and XGBoost as comparison. This project also provides step by step preprocessing, ANOVA testing, and visualization.

This project uses two simple concepts, that is supervised learning and linear regression. Supervised Learning is a Machine Learning algorithm that is commonly used to solve classification and regression problems.

Some of the algorithms included in the Supervised Learning category include:
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Naive Bayes
- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
- Decision Trees
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)
- Neural Networks

Supervised Learning requires a set of "paired" data, which has input variables (features) and output variables (targets). This dataset is then used in the training process. Supervised Learning works by mapping functions that connect input (x) and output (y).

Meanwhile, Linear Regression is an approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable y and one or more independent variables x. Linear regression is suitable for problems that are continuous. Past data is used to predict the future, such as: Predicting stock prices and economic growth, salary estimation, predicting house prices, etc.
